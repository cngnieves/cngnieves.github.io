                    How are you strawberry dandan? Hope you are enjoying college right now even without me there by your side. Know that I miss you very much. Let’s go back to memory lane. I met you in grade one when we were first became classmates I don’t remember much back then since makakalimutin naman talaga ako. Pero what I do remember is the moment we became stuck together. In grade 2 the first day of class I went home via bus and I saw ate tin (Di ko sure kung si ate tin talaga) na may kasamang bago I was like in my head “EEEY MAY BAGO NA AKONG BUsmate” then I saw ur hair pigtails na naka braid and I remember na thats how you usually styled ur hair back in grade 1 so I guessed uy baka si dandan nga and true enough it was you!! So i would like to thank mang lee for making this friendship xxtra strong hehehe. I am so thankful to have met you and be stuck with u for more than 11 years now. You have seen my through my ups and downs, and I am grateful to have such an understanding and loving friend. We literally grew up together and i have seen you grow into a better person each day. I do not think i would’ve survived grade school and high school without you by my side. College Nikki misses you right now!! Even if we are separated and our schools are mortal enemies ik deep in mah our friendship will still be strong. bc despite our busy lives its so easy for the both of us to click and catch up. I am glad that my best friend can do so much!! You are such a great actress, funny person and so kind hearted, you are truly a treasure to everyone. You have done so much!!! I remember when you first joined banaag and I knew you would do so well there and I’m so happy for how much you have come.  I would like to thank you for all the memories we had together and i am excited for the many more memories to come. Thank you for all the advices you have given me and listening to all my rants. Thank you also for being there for me all the time, know that i got your back always! I love you so much. I hope you know how much of a blessing you are to everyone, not just me. You can literally make anyone smile and make everyone feel better on a sad day. Tauruses and Scorpios make great friends, maybe thats why despite the distance and the separations we will always have a strong bond.
